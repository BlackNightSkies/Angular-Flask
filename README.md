# Angular-Flask
 A web application database project using AngularJS, Python Flask, and either MySQL or PostgreSQL(TBD)

## Reference
This project used the Python Flask Tutorial by Corey Schafer on Youtube.

## Set Up
Environment setup is up to user preference, but my particular setup is as follows:
- IDE: PyCharm Community Edition 19.3.3
- OS: Windows 10
- Libraries/Dependencies
  - Flask 1.1.2
  - Jinja 2.11.2
  - Werkzeug 1.0.1

All libraries, dependencies and code were kept and updated within the same local folder on my machine, which then became my local GitHub repository that I have uploaded here.
